# Challenges:
## Traffic light:
  - this one was pretty simple, i started off with 3 LEDS( red, yellow and green) , one bread board, 3 resistors, and a push button
  - i placed the LEDs in the way a traffic light would look like. then connected them to pin 9,10,11 respectivly to the aurdunio board and connected the other pin of the leds to the resistor, connected to the jumper wires. then connected the push button's one pin to digital pin 2 and ground.
  - and then after inserting the code , it worked
