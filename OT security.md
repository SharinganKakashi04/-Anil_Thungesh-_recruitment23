# OT SECURITY
 started reading about ot security from the resources given in the discord server, from the google docs link

 i learned about the basics of Operational technology,threat landscape, access control,patch management, anomaly detection,etc.
 ## OT basics:
- learned this part from tenable.Operational technology keep all important porcesses and cirtical infrastructure of a control system functioning
- few ot devices,Programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
                 Remote terminal units (RTUs)
                 Industrial control systems (ICS)
                  Distributed control systems (DCS)
                 Human machine interfaces (HMIs)
                 Supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA)
                 Internet of things (IoT) devices
- ot security protects the hardware and software within the ot infrastructure, and all steps taken in it are used to protect internal and external attacks.
- Information technology is used to process, manage, store and protect information in what is generally a stable environment. The focus in IT is on security.
   OT is used to monitor, manage and control physical devices and related processes. unlike IT, security is not given much importance because of the complex management system.
- but now , IT-OT convergence is happening, which gives arise to new problems of attacks, since they r in the same envirounment

  ## Threat landscape:
- there r many types of threats that can be made.
- ransomware and malware is commonly used, malware can distrupt OT systems and their processess, and this can be used for ransom.
- insider attacks are usually seen within IT-OT envirnoments,people with malicious intent in IT can distrupt or gain info from the OT envirounments.
- due to lack of patch management, outdated systems r easily atatcked
- due to complex systems and processes running, it makes it challenging to identify a threat.

  # How to protect the OT systems:
- there are various methods use din protecting OT systems,
- ## Segmentation :
- network segmentation is used to isolate OT systems from the enterprise IT network,thus preventing potential attacks and compromises.
- ## Access control:
- Strict access control measures should be implemented, including strong authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls, and least privilege principles. this ensures that only authorized personnel are allowed to modify OT architecture.
- ## Patch management:
- keeping the systems updated and patched up regulary helps in preventing attacks, since outdated systems are more vulnerable to such attacks. the patches must be tested beforehand to avoid any distruptions
- ## Anomaly detection:
  usage of specialized devices and proccesses to identify and monitor any suspicious or unusual activies in the OT environments
