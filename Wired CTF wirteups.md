3. then i tried pressing the button on theboard and got a pulse in the app.
4.it had the flag in it

PCB_REVERSING:
1.after i decoded the gerber file, i got the blueprint of the circuit
2. then, i opened tinkerCAD, and setup the circuit according to the connections, this took 2hrs
3.then finally after the connections were done, i tried all the possible 4 value truth table combos
4.finally it hit at 1101 combo and the LED lit, and i posted it and got the flag
5.for this , i had to get some help from friends.

 ACHAN\'S FAVOURITE:
 1.After downloading the .wav file, i put it into a sound analyser

flag - wired{Italy}

3. and got the flag

get wired 1:
1. got it from the lab

get wired 2:
2.got it from discord

welcome flag:

WIRED_SHARK:
1. downloaded wireshark
2. opened the given file in wired shark, and the contents opened
3. found the flag amoung the lines in wireshark

Whats_up_Doh:
1. opened the file in wireshark
2. while scanning along the lines, i tried to find out idk567 from the clue given
3. then with the help of seniors, i sorted the lines into script,and then searched for it
4. then i found the flag

Simple_web:
1. I opened the webpage
2. Then inspected it, and was scanning though the HTML code for the flag
3. when i didnt get anything, i went to sources> script, with some help of seniors
4. then i found the encrypted flag, decrypted it with dcode to get the flag

da_one_where_u_visualize:
1. i dont remember this

Crypto layers:
1.binary code given i converted to text, and then this encrypted text.
2. this text i used the cipher decoder from dcode, and then got another code.
3. then using the hints, i found that i had to using Vignere cipher , after using it i got the flag

MICHEALS_PARADISE:
1.opened the attachment and found a picture.
2.using google lens, i found the name of the bridge and write it in the format of the flag

DOTS AND DASHES:
1.the recording for the morse code was given by the seniors
2.using a youtube video which showed sound for each aphabet into morse code, i decoded and found the flag
3. i believe it was the meme"it is what it is"
