## HTML 
i started learning HTML from codeacademy, and leanred about the basic syntax and learned the uses of them mainly from google.
some basic tags that i learned
<body> used to specify the content in the HTML page
<p> used to write a paragraph
<html>, used at the start of html page
<img> must contain src(source attribute), whose value is to output a image URL
 <!DOCTYPE> must before starting html code
 etc, and with the help of these i was able to build a simple portfolio
