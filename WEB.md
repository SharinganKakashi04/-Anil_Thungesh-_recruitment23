## HTML 
i started learning HTML from codeacademy, and leanred about the basic syntax and learned the uses of them mainly from google.
some basic tags that i learned

1. body tag..< body > used to specify the content in the HTML page
2. paragraph tag..< p > used to write a paragraph
3. html tag...< html >, used at the start of html page
4. image tag...< img > must contain src(source attribute), whose value is to output a image URL
5. doctype tag..< !DOCTYPE > must before starting html code
  , etc, and with the help of these i was able to build a simple portfolio

## CSS
used codeacademy to learn

# PICOCTF:
## Powercookie:
- first i read about cookies and their functions, then leaned how to mmodify them
- opened the the website given the the task and then inspected, which gave me access to the html and css code
- then in Application tab > cookies > i was able to see that the value of the cookie was 0, which means it is a false value
- once i changed the valule to 1 and refreshed the page, i got the flag
